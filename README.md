# Calculator Project

A simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It also includes functionality for clearing the input and handling edge cases like division by zero.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`X`), division (`รท`), modulus (`%`), and equals (`=`).
- **Clear Button**: Clears the current input and resets the calculator state.
- **Zero Handling**: Handles edge cases like operations involving zero and displays results correctly.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator layout.
- **CSS**: Styling for the calculator interface, including buttons and display.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd calculator
    ```
3. Open `calc.html` in your browser to start using the calculator.

## How It Works

- **Input**: When the user clicks buttons, their input is appended to the display.
- **Calculations**: When the user presses the equals button (`=`), the input is parsed and the result is calculated based on the selected operator.
- **Clear Function**: Pressing the `C` button resets the calculator, clearing the display and the internal variables.
- **Zero Handling**: The code ensures proper handling when `0` is used in operations like addition or division.

## Future Improvements

- Support for advanced operations (square root, exponentiation, etc.).
- User interface enhancements (animations, themes).
- Better error handling and validation for user inputs.
